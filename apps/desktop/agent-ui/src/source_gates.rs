//! Structural ratchet gates (§J.6 groundwork; migration items U1/U2/U3/U6/U9).
//!
//! The desktop's kernel-bypass surface is frozen at its audited count: these
//! gates can only ever be loosened by REMOVING bypass sites and ratcheting
//! the budget down, never by adding sites. Each pattern family names the
//! migration that retires it:
//! - store mirror writes (`with_mut(|s|`) — U3 single-writer: the server
//!   pump owns the thread-store flags; the desktop mirror writes are
//!   redundant in-proc and race the pump across processes.
//! - facade writes (`with_mut(|t|` / `with_mut(|thread|`) — U1/U6: user
//!   intent goes through the gateway (`ClientCall::Submit` etc.); rendering
//!   state comes from the client store, not a locally driven kernel facade.
//! - store reads (`thread_store::global()` / `thread_store_global()`) — U2:
//!   lists and summaries come from `ListThreads` + host events. Landed for
//!   the list/registry surface (the sidebar reads the multiplexer's wire
//!   rows; its budget is 0); the workspace residue is itemized in the
//!   budget table below.
//! - protocol sends outside the gateway client — U9 layering: views talk to
//!   the multiplexer, never to the wire directly.
//!
//! Counts are production-side only: each file is truncated at its first
//! `#[cfg(test)]` marker before counting.
