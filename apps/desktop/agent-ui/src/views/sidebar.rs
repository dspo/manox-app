//! Conversation history sidebar.
//!
//! A standalone gpui Entity that lists past threads from the gateway (U2):
//! the rows are the multiplexer's wire `ThreadListItem`s (§D.5
//! `ThreadsUpdated` mirrors / `ListThreads` responses with the
//! `SessionStatus` deltas merged in) — the former kernel `StoreHandle` event
//! pump is retired. The decoration columns (project grouping, tag chip,
//! approval wash) ride the wire rows and the grouping registry rides the
//! `HostEvent::Projects` mirror (U2 cross-domain #1). Clicking a
//! conversation entry emits
//! `OpenThread(id)`; the "Conversations" section header's "+" opens the
//! flat new-session menu and each project folder header's ellipsis button opens the project
//! action menu (new session / terminal / VS Code / remove project). Workspace subscribes to
//! these events.
//!
//! Threads bound to a project (chosen on the first screen) are grouped under a collapsible folder
//! in the "Projects" section, keyed by project path; the rest fall under "Conversations". The top
//! menu and bottom account footer are static decoration.
