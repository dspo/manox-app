## manox-app UI chrome strings.
##
## This is the ONLY place manox-app user-facing chrome text lives. The primary
## locale is Simplified Chinese (zh-CN.ftl); English (en.ftl) is the fallback.
## Keys are grouped by source file for navigability; ids use `-` (fluent
## forbids `.`).
##
## Scope is strictly app chrome. Anything the manox runtime hands this app —
## tool titles/summaries, slash-command descriptions, plan prose, model output —
## is rendered verbatim and NEVER resolved through these bundles.
