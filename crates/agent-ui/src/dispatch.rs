//! Process-global handles for dispatching actions from outside the view tree.
//!
//! macOS system menu items are evaluated against App-level `on_action`
//! handlers, not the view tree's local listeners. Dispatching the
//! `OpenSettings` action through such a handler therefore needs a way to
//! reach the active window's `Workspace` from `&mut App`. Stashing the entity
//! and the window handle here at window creation time gives the App-level
//! handler a stable handle (the `cx.active_window()` handle from a menu
//! callback is unreliable on macOS — it can point at a `WindowId` that the
//! App's window map has not registered yet, surfacing as `Err(window not
//! found)`).
//!
//! The process keeps a single main window, but that window may be closed and
//! re-opened (the system-tray "open" path): `WORKSPACE` is populated exactly
//! once and held for the process lifetime — the strong `Entity` reference is
//! what keeps the foreground `Thread` and any parked background threads alive
//! while no window exists — while `WINDOW` is replaced each time a new window
//! is opened over the same `Workspace`. A stale `WindowHandle` read between
//! close and re-open simply fails its `update`, which App-level handlers
//! already tolerate. If a future change ever supports multiple windows, these
//! slots will need to become a map keyed by `WindowId` and the App-level
//! handlers will need to pick the target window (e.g. from `cx.active_window()`
//! after the deferred dispatch).
