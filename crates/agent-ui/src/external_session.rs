//! External agent CLI sessions (claude / codex / copilot) launched from the
//! sidebar's `+` menu.
//!
//! An `ExternalSession` owns a `TerminalView` rendering the agent's TUI (driven
//! through a `CxSessionSource` PTY source that wraps the shared
//! `cx::SessionHandle`) plus the `Arc<SessionHandle>` itself, so the close path
//! can `kill` the agent explicitly.
//!
//! Agent-kind sessions survive an app exit as a [`ResumeSidecar`]: the sidecar
//! is written at spawn, deleted only when the session is explicitly closed, and
//! re-scanned at startup. A sidecar left on disk is therefore exactly an
//! *unclosed* session — the user re-opens it from the sidebar and manox
//! re-spawns the CLI targeting the sidecar's captured CLI session id
//! (`claude --resume <id>` / `codex resume <id>`; the CLI's own picker when no
//! id was captured, `copilot --continue`), so the CLI's on-disk conversation
//! storage picks the exact conversation back up. Plain PTY shells are never
//! persisted (nothing to resume).
